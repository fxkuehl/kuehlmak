Mid term (1.x)
========

These changes are unlikely to break the CLI, config file format or corpus JSON.

- use background color in heat map (blue-cyan-grey-magenta-red-yellow)
  (create color buckets based on letter frequencies so that each bucket
   represents about the same number of keystrokes)
- use font color for n-grams (green-<neutral>-red, if target is set)
- implement normalizing and mixing of corpora
- with normalized corpora, try if using u32 instead of u64 is faster for
  counting key costs and n-grams
  may also have advantages of preserving accuracy in conversion to f64 scores
- try if f32 for travel and scores has any perf advantage
- implement filtering of layouts (in rank and stats subcommands) by score-based
  conditions

Longer term (2.x)
===========

More involved changes that can break the CLI, config file format or corpus JSON.
Also some nice-to-haves.

- Insert Shift before first in a sequence of capitalized letter or shifted
  symbols
  - Promoting bigrams 'lU' or ' U' to trigrams 'l_U' or ' _U'
  - Drop 3-grams that include such bigrams
- add support for thumb letters
  - need a representation of thumb keys
    (are they part of the same hand or counted as separate for letter and
     n-gram stats?)
- [maybe] Change constraint configuration with one group for each constraint
- Constraint for soft-pinning keys. Maybe this could replace the ref_layout
  constraint. Could specify different weights for same-finger, same-hand,
  other-hand. And a global threshold.
- CLI changes:
  - update to newer version of clap
  - kuehlmak config (show config: weights instead of stats, update config file)
  - kuehlmak eval -i (interactive mode) (later)
  - [maybe] kuehlmak reset (delete kbl files)
- output options:
  - [maybe] visualize column-stagger (two rows on top)
  - output HTML (with color)
- add histogram plotting for population stats


How to ignore ranking output and manually edited layouts in ranking?
====================================================================
- Use a different file extension
- Use a special prefix for layouts from annealing
- ***Ignore layouts that don't have a ### popularity line***
- Maybe: ***Add option to specify files to rank***

Setting targets for scores with curves
======================================
Applying a curve to a score. Use a power function with exponent p and slope = 1
at the target value T. For p > 1, the slope is < 1 for x < T, or > 1 for x > T.
For scores with negative weight, use the equivalent root function (p < 1).

c(x) = a * x^p
c'(x) = a*p * x^(p-1)

c'(T) = 1 = a*p * T^(p-1) <==>  a = 1 / (p * T^(p-1))

           x^p
c(x) = -----------
       p * T^(p-1)

Example: p = 2

c(x) = x^2 / (2T)
c'(x) = x/T
c'(T) = 1

Example: p = 3

c(x) = x^3 / (3T^2)
c'(x) = 3x^2 / (3T^2) = x^2 / T^2
c'(T) = 1
